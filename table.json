We also aim to highlight the Modders themselves!\n\n\n\n**Last thing!**\n\nThe phrase 'for free' DOES NOT mean mods will be paid for in future, don't worry! It just means that the mod was not a commission, and the mod creator didn't make any money from the mod, hence it released for free.\n\nWere also working on a website!

You couldn't change config, it would always get set back to default.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nIt's been quite some time since I last updated this mod, but trust me, it was worth it.\n\nI've added quite a few things, as well as improved the performance a ton.\n\n\n\nHere's the current feature list:\n\n- Displays colorful text every time you cut a block\n\n- Supports configuration files that are identical to configuration files from the PC HitScoreVisualizer mod\n\n- Supports custom text, configurable thresholds, and more all within the configuration file\n\n- Has seasonal configurations (With a special treat coming soon within the next few days!)\n\n\n\nBut there's much more to come! I plan on adding the following within the next few days:\n\n- Configurable text and colors from IN GAME!\n\n- More seasonal configurations\n\n- More configurable options (did someone say particles?)\n\n- Even more performance updates\n\n- Color fading and customizable colors within the text (rainbow colored text!)\n\n\n\nThis mod works on Beat Saber v1.6.x and BMBF v1.5.0, as well as Beat Saber v1.7.0 with BMBF v1.7.0\n\nThis mod has also been submitted to the Christmas BSMG Competition! I strongly recommend submitting something you have made as well!\n\nGitHub (no releases posted yet, just source code here): https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestHitScoreVisualizer/tree/dev_hsv/hitscorevisualizer\n\nThe configuration file is located at: /sdcard/Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files/mod_cfgs/HitScoreVisualizer.json\n\nHaving issues?
