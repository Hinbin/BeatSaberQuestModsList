<a name="No-Fail-Check"></a>
**No Fail Check 0.1.0 for Beat Saber 1.9.0**

Source code at https://github.com/Futuremappermydud/NoFailCheck-Quest

Currently does not have double clicks working but the text changing works!



Basicly when you have no fail activated it changes the play text too "No Fail!" and when its working it will require you too double click the button

<a name="Mapping-Extensions"></a>
**Mapping Extensions 0.17.0 for Beat Saber 1.9.0**

Source code at https://github.com/zoller27osu/QuestMods/tree/master/MappingExtensions

Thanks to @Kyle 1413#1413 for the PC original and the original Quest port (which the source can merge into once his other Quest mods update). Also thanks to @Pink#3877 for testing.

It supports the same maps but left-handed mode should work now (enjoy the backwards text in some songs if you do though)

<a name="Intro-Skip"></a>
**Intro Skip**

This mod allows you to skip long intros, outros, or big gaps in the middle of a song. This is very useful for maps like Recollection or G1ll35. This mod also features a configuration file which allows you to customize where the text is, the color of the text, timings for the skips, and if you want middle skips enabled. Note that if there are bombs then it will not skip as that would be cheating.

**Motion Blur Disabler by futuremappermydud** 

This mod disables the annoying white line which is inside the saber. This mod is made 100% by iplay games!#6969 / futuremappermydud, I'm just uploading it for him. The image down here actually makes it look better without the mod lol, but it shows how it works.

<a name="QSettingsPlus"></a>
**QSettingsPlus**

  Features: 

- Being able to disable and enable things with config!

- What you can enable and disable: 

     - Saber Glow 

     - Wall Transparrency 

     - Wall Glow

- decrease or increase particles to be between 0 to 50 when cutting a cube! 



Known bugs:

Wall frame doesn't get a color



How do I change the settings? 



First time after you have opened Beat Saber with QSettingsPlus it will create a config!



You can find the config in Quest → Android → data → com.beatgames.beatsaber → files → mod_cfgs



You open QSettingsPlus.Json in preferred text editor 

and change example GlowOnWalls to be "true" if you want the glow back.



When you want to save you do file → save as and choose a place like desktop and save it as QSettingsPlus.json 



Now you would want to drag it over to mod_cfgs to overwrite the current one that's created!

<a name="Volume-Config"></a>
**Volume Config for Beat Saber 1.8.0**

Allows you to edit:

**ChromaLite for Oculus Quest Beat Saber 1.8.0**

i told you 1.8.0 was going to be big for quest modding. :yayy: 



This is a Quest port of skykiwi's PC Mod 'ChromaLite'. It enables the use of Custom ChromaLite Lighting Events in certain maps which use it.

Thanks a ton to @Sc2ad#8836 for helping me figure out stuff!

<a name="Notice-Board"></a>
**Notice Board**

We're finally releasing! 

After a long wait we're here to bring you all the Notice Board mod!



**What does it do exactly?**

This mod is designed to help you with your modding experience. It will ***never*** interrupt gameplay and will only be noticeable right at the start of the game

This mod will tell you:

- When a mod updates and where to get it from

- When a mod releases and where to get it from

- When BMBF updates

- When the Game updates 

- Tips for common modding issues and how to fix them



**Whats the point?**

Most of the quest player base are not here or on discord, there's over 100,000 people who've followed online tutorials for BMBF and Modding. Helping these people get the best experience they can is my #1 priority right now. We also aim to highlight the Modders themselves!



**Last thing!**

The phrase 'for free' DOES NOT mean mods will be paid for in future, don't worry! It just means that the mod was not a commission, and the mod creator didn't make any money from the mod, hence it released for free.

Were also working on a website! So you can view this news in more detail from wherever you are!



The Discord is 'Unavailable' as the server is not ready for any new members, once we re-work it the link will be within the mod!

<a name="Max-Rumble"></a>

<a name="Note-Spawn-Effect-Remover"></a>
**NoteSpawnEffectRemover v0.1.0**

What does it do?

- Removes the note spawn effect. You know what I'm talking about.

The code for this mod is literally 15 lines long (and that's with comments and explanations) so it's not on GitHub yet because I am too lazy to either make a new repo or a new project folder just for one mod (forgive me).

If you want to see the source code, just DM me and I'll send you literally all of it, lol.

Happy Holidays everyone!

<a name="Redbar"></a>
**Redbar 1.1.2**

This mod makes your energy (health) bar change color, based on your current health!

Enjoy!

**No Level Failed**

<a name="Spinny-Saber"></a>
**Spinny Saber**

This makes your sabers spin for aesthetics.

It is best when used with a radially symmetric saber that has words around it.

Edit: If you want it to spin faster then message me and I will give you one that spins more.

<a name="VolumeChanger-aka-AdaptiveSFXRemover"></a>
**VolumeChanger 1.0.2 (BeatSaber 1.7.0 Update)**

aka AdaptiveSFXRemover

This is half a port of @Shadnix 's PC Mod, 'AdaptiveSFXRemover'



As soon as the mod is enabled, it will disable the AdaptiveSFX.

Set SFX Volume on the left hand side in Player Settings to 1.0 for best results!

On top of that the mod allows you individually to edit your:

- Cut Sound Volume

- Bad Cut Sound Volume

- Main Menu Music & Song Previews Volume



All of this is done by a config file, NOT IN GAME.

Load the mod up once and a file will be created in the path below which you can then edit to your likings.

Download the config file from that path to your PC, edit it on your PC then delete the old file from your quest and upload the new one. If any config file on your quest contains [1] then you have done it wrong! they MUST be named the same thing.



All custom sound effect mods you currently have installed will work with this mod!



File path:

Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files/mod_cfgs/



Config Example:

{

    "goodCutVolume": 1.41,

    "badCutVolume": 0.31,

    "OverallMenuVolume": 1.0

}



Make sure that these values are floats and not integers (1.0, not 1).

*IF YOU SET YOUR VOLUME TO SOMETHING WAY TOO HIGH AND DAMAGE YOUR HEADSET, THATS ON YOU!

**Game Rumble Disabler V1.0.1, Should work on 99% of game versions**

WARNING, YOU REQUESTED IT BUT IT FEELS WEIRD AS FUCK. IM NOT KIDDING... YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. YOU'LL PROBABLY DISABLE IT, THIS MOD FEELS SUPER WEIRD.



Disables:

- Wall Collision Rumble

- Saber Clash Rumble

- Note Clash Rumble

- Bomb Clash Rumble



This DOES NOT Disable rumble in the menus. its gameplay rumble only!

<a name="OSU-Click-Note-Hit-Sound"></a>
**OSU Click Note Hit Sound v1.1.1! - 1.6.x (Repost because I posted the wrong zips)**

Now makes your blocks and menu clicky! But if you don't like the sound of that, there's now a version without the menu click.

This version also contains a quieter menu click and the menu click is now centered rather than playing out of the right more than the left! Thanks to @Pink  and @(╯°□°)╯︵sɓuᴉꓘ߈ᘔ  for helping with that.



If you're switching from the menu click version to the one without, make sure when you disable the mod, sync, then remove it because during testing I accidentally got rid of the menu sound by not syncing in between.



This will work with all versions of 1.6 but won't auto update.

<a name="Advanced-Config"></a>
**Advanced Config v0.1.1 for BeatSaber 1.6.0**

Want a mod which violates god? ME TOO!

Here you go, have advanced config.



What does it do I hear no one ask?

- Change your Slash Volume

(Ive not set a limit, go crazy! just dont break your headset)

- Change your Bad Cut Volume

(0.0 Means the Bad Cut/Bomb Sound gets completely muted. no seriously don't blame me if you set it to 1000.0 and break your headset, there could be a base game limit tho.)

- Disable the new Adaptive SFX

(This is a port of Shadnix's AdaptiveSFXRemover v1.0.1, I genuinely don't know if it works or not as my ears aren't good enough to tell. Please message me Pink#3877 if it works or not)

- Disable the Flashing E on the 'Beat Saber' Sign in menus

- Disable the 'Flying Score Effect'

(The 1-115 Numbers which show up after you slash a note)

- Change the Overall Menu Volume

(Doesn't effect the click sound, but every other sound in the menu changes to whatever you set. like genuinely don't break your headset)

- Updated to the latest BS Hook



THIS MOD DOESNT HAVE ANY UI!

To change all of these values, you must edit its config file which is located in

This PC\Quest\Internal shared storage\Android\data\com.beatgames.beatsaber\files\mod_cfgs\AdvancedConfig.json



Config options are below and are pretty self explanatory.



Thanks to Rugtveit and Sc2ad for letting me cry to them when stuff didn't work.

<a name="Hit-Score-Visualizer"></a>
**HitScoreVisualizer 3.0.1 for Oculus Quest**

Why the repost? You couldn't change config, it would always get set back to default.

ORIGINAL POST:

It's been quite some time since I last updated this mod, but trust me, it was worth it.

I've added quite a few things, as well as improved the performance a ton.



Here's the current feature list:

- Displays colorful text every time you cut a block

- Supports configuration files that are identical to configuration files from the PC HitScoreVisualizer mod

- Supports custom text, configurable thresholds, and more all within the configuration file

- Has seasonal configurations (With a special treat coming soon within the next few days!)



But there's much more to come! I plan on adding the following within the next few days:

- Configurable text and colors from IN GAME!

- More seasonal configurations

- More configurable options (did someone say particles?)

- Even more performance updates

- Color fading and customizable colors within the text (rainbow colored text!)



This mod works on Beat Saber v1.6.x and BMBF v1.5.0, as well as Beat Saber v1.7.0 with BMBF v1.7.0

This mod has also been submitted to the Christmas BSMG Competition! I strongly recommend submitting something you have made as well!

GitHub (no releases posted yet, just source code here): https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestHitScoreVisualizer/tree/dev_hsv/hitscorevisualizer

The configuration file is located at: /sdcard/Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files/mod_cfgs/HitScoreVisualizer.json

Having issues? Send @skadman a DM!
